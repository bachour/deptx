OMG You did it! Well done! I'm so impressed! You did it in way fewer tries than me! You pointed out the inconsistency and now {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.unit.serial}} clerks will be able to fix it and make sure our archive is error-free!

But first you must submit this document back to {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.unit.serial}}, otherwise your work on this document cannot be logged.

Which is great because we get to play with forms again!! I'm tingling with excitement at the idea. You need to do two things: first you need to acquire the correct form to submit the document. Then you need to actually submit the document. 

Here's what you need to do:
1.	Acquire a blank {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.unit.serial}}'s document submission form (all form IDs can be found in the Guidebook). If you forgot how to do that just go back to the first email I sent you.
2.	Fill in the form with the document ID in the data field, and sign it.
3.	Go to the Compose page.
4.	Select {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.unit.serial}} as the recipient.
5.	Select "Submitting document" as the subject.
6.	Select the form you just signed as the form to send.
7.	Select the document you just modified as the document to send.
8.	Click send.
9.	Wait for a response from {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.unit.serial}}.

If you followed these steps correctly, you should receive an email from {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.unit.serial}} informing you that you have successfully submitted the report.

You will also receive another email from the {{tutorialData.mopco.name}} explaining the next steps.
