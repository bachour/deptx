The system logged a modification to the document! Looks like you've been busy! Unfortunately, it appears you didn't select the correct attributes. I know, it took me a while to figure it out too! But don't worry; you still have a chance to fix it.

Go back to the Document Drawer and click the Work button to try again. Look for two attributes whose values should be the same, but are different. Once you find them, mark them both in red and hit 'Save'.

When you do that, you will receive a new email with further information.
