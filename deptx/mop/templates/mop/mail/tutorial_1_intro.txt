Welcome to the Ministry of Provenance!

I'm Sandy and I'll be teaching you about how to be a productive member in the ORCHID scheme! Isn't this exciting!

The Ministry is all about Provenance! And you will do Provenance work as well. Isn't that awesome?

Here is a quick reminder of what Provenance actually is, just sit back and enjoy!

Now about your actual work. You will look at Provenance records and check them for us. This is a very important task, and we are so happy that you have become an ORCHID Citizen Helper! Thanks! :D

The different departments of the Ministry all produce Provenance records. In order to access these records, you need to request them - with a form - from the responsible department.

However, in order to do so, you need the correct form! At MoP, we LOVE forms! With time you'll learn to love them too!


Let's start and get you a new form: "{{tutorialData.document_requisition.name}}".

1.	Go to the "Blank Forms" page from the "Control Centre" (I suggest you open it in a new window or tab so you can come back to these steps easily).

2. At the top you can see two forms. The first one is used to request new forms. The second one allows you to contact me or another member of {{tutorialData.mopco.serial}} if you have any questions.

3. At the bottom you see a list with forms that you still need to acquire. Let's get the {{tutorialData.document_requisition.unit.name}} form! That form is used to request Provenance records from {{tutorialData.document_requisition.unit.serial}}. Just press the "request" button next to it - that's a shortcut!

4. You are now on a new page, filling in the form for requesting a new form. Everything is already prepared for you - just press "sign" to add your digital signature.

5. This brings you to all the forms that you have signed but not yet used. Press the "mail" button next to your form.

6. Now you are composing an email to MOPADM. Our email client is intelligent and so has already pre-filled the interface based on the form that you are sending. Leave everything as it is and press "send message". And *swhoooosh* the form request is on the way.

If you followed these steps correctly, you should receive an email from the {{tutorialData.form_requisition.unit.name}} informing you that you have access to the new form. How exciting!

You will also receive another email from the {{tutorialData.mopco.name}} explaining the next steps. 


Best of luck!

Kind regards,
