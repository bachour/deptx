Yay!! Looks like you've successfully acquired your first blank form! I think I just got goosebumps! I don't even remember the last time I got a new blank form! Now let's use it! 

The form you now have allows you to request documents from {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.serial}} - the {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.name}}. {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.serial}} is the unit of MoP that is responsible for any document that is related to transport: speeding tickets, drivers' licenses, train travel documents. Anything you can think of related to transport!

As a Ministry of Provenance Citizen Helper, your main task will be to check our documents and make sure they're all in order. The more documents you check, the better your performance record! We call your performance record TRUST (Total Rating of Successful Tasks). Your clearance level and the types of documents you can access are determined by your TRUST.

The document pool page shows all documents that are currently available for you to check based on your clearance level. Your starting clearance level is Blue. 

In order to work on the document, you first need to request access to it. You can do this by submitting the {{tutorialData.requisition.name}} form you acquired in the first step. Here's how to do it:

1.	Go to the Document Pool page from the Control Centre.
2.  You will see that {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.serial}} is currently offering a document: checking the provenance related to a {{tutorialData.document.mopDocument.name}}.
3.  Copy the Document ID of that document.
4.	Go to the Blank Forms page.
5.	Select the {{tutorialData.requisition.name}} form {{tutorialData.requisition.serial}}.
6.	Enter the Document ID in the Data field.
7.	Sign the form.
8.	Click "mail".
9.	Select {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.serial}} as the recipient.
10.	Select "Requesting document" as the subject.
11.	Click Send.
12.	Wait for a response from {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.serial}}.

If you followed these steps correctly, you should receive an email from {{tutorialData.requisition.unit.serial}} informing you that you have access to the new document.

You will also receive another email from the {{tutorialData.mopco.name}} explaining the next steps.
