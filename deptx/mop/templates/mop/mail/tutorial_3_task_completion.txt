Fantastic! You have successfully acquired your first provenance record! I can feel you becoming a different person already!

This particular record that you have now is a very simple one: it shows the provenance of a speeding ticket. Who got it, when and why.

Let's do a quick recap how provenance works. You have already seen this video during your recruitment, but let's refresh our memories anyways!

Now here comes the fun part! Someone did something wrong when this speeding ticket was issued and its provenance record is all messed up. The Ministry doesn't tolerate inconsistencies in our databases. So your job is to help us remove them! You will do so by examining the graph and highlighting the information you think is wrong.

Here's what you need to do:
1.	Go to the Document Drawer page in the Control Center.
2.	Click the Work button next to the document you have.
3.	This will launch the PROMPT, the Provenance Viewer.
4.	Move nodes around by dragging them with your mouse pointer.
5.	Clicking a node will allow you to examine it by giving you more information about the node attributes in one of the two attribute panes on the right. 
6.	Examine the three nodes.
7.	You can only view two nodes at a time, so to look at the third, you must first remove one of the other two by clicking on the node again.
8.	There are two attributes each belonging to one node that logically should be the same (or similar), but aren't.
9.  Find those two attributes that you think are inconsistent.
9.	Click those two attributes so they are both highlighted in red.
10.	Click the Save button at the bottom right.

If you followed these steps correctly, you will receive another email from the {{tutorialData.mopco.name}} explaining the next steps.
