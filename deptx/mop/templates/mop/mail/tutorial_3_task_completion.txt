Great! You have successfully acquired your first provenance record. You can view it by going to the Tasks page and clicking on the Work button.

This is a simple graph that shows the record of someone receiving a speeding ticket. It shows the main person involved, and the main activity that led to the speeding ticket. Each node in the graph also has attributes such as name, date of birth, and other information about the node.

For a whole bunch of reasons that we won't get into now, there are often errors in the records and we need people like you to help spot them. The document you have received has been flagged for a possible error. Have a look at the record and see if you can figure out what's wrong.

Here's what you need to do:
1.	Go to the Tasks page.
2.	Click the Work button on the task you have.
3.	This will launch the Provenance Viewer.
4.	Move nodes around by dragging them with your mouse pointer.
5.	Clicking nodes will allow you to examine them by giving you more information about the node attributes in one of the two attribute panes on the right. 
6.	Examine the three nodes.
7.	You can only view two nodes at a time, so to look at the third, you must first remove one of the other two by clicking on the node again.
8.	Find the two attributes that you think are inconsistent (they will be in two separate nodes).
9.	Click those two attributes so they are both highlighted in red.
10.	Click the Save button at the bottom right.

If you followed these steps correctly, you will receive another email from the {{tutorialData.mopco.name}} explaining the next steps.
