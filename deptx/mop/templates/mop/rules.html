<h2><a class="internal" id="q1">What is Provenance?</a></h2>
<p>
Provenance is a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities, involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing.
It is the sum of all we know about the history of an object. Any object. Whether it's an online document or a wooden chair.

The Ministry of Provenance was setup by government to keep track of all these records. 
In 2013, the Ministry launched the ORCHID scheme to allow citizens to help us maintain this large archive of records.

</p>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q2">What is a Provenance Record?</a></h2>
<p>
Here's a quick orientation video explaining the basics of Provenance Records.
<br/>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/O13PK0YyH8A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br/>
A Proveance Record is made of nodes and edges. Nodes represent:
<ul>
<li>Agent: Any person person, organization or program that creates, alters, or otherwise influences an object or thing.</li>
<li>Entity: Any object or thing that we are intersted in the history of, or that is part of the history of another object.</li>
<li>Activity: Any process by which agents interact with entities to create, later or otherwise influence them.</li>
</ul>
These nodes are connected by edges or arrows that represent the relationships between them. <br/> 
<img src="mop/basicprovexample.jpg">
<br/>
In the example above we can see the provenance of the book Les Miserables.
<ul>
<li>The book itself is an entity (circular node).</li> 
<li>It's author is Victor Hugo, an agent (house-shaped node).</li>
<li>The activity by which it was created is called "Write" (rectangular node).</li>
</ul>
<br>
The arrows between the nodes indicate their relationship:
<ul>
<li>The arrow from Activity: Write to Victor Hugo indicates the Hugo is the person who did the writing.</li> 
<li>The arrow from the book itself to the activity write indicates that the book is the result of the writing.</li>
<li>And finally the arrow from the book to Victor Hugo indicate that the book is attributed to Hugo.</li>
</ul>
This is a basic example of provenance. Things can get considerably more complicated as relationships between agents, activities and entities become significantly more complex.

<h2><a class="internal" id="q3">How is the Ministry of Provenance organized?</a></h2>
<p>
The Ministry of Provenance is divided into several units which are working together and with each other to improve the life of all citizens.
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Unit</th><th>Identifier</th><th>Description</th></tr>
{% for unit in unit_list %}
<tr><td>{{unit.name}}</td><td>{{unit.serial}}</td><td>{{unit.description}}</td></tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q4">What is the ORCHID scheme?</a></h2>
<p>ORCHID stands for <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>R</strong>ecruitment of <strong>C</strong>itizen <strong>H</strong>elpers for <strong>I</strong>nternal <strong>D</strong>eployment.</p>
<p>ORCHID strives to include qualified citizens in the complex (but rewarding!) tasks of helping the Ministry of Provenance. Governmental structures are increasingly turning to Citizen Helpers to jointly solve problems that defy conventional computational approaches. We are developing approaches that allow such problems to be solved at scale, making full use of the skills, preferences and capabilities of the Citizen Helpers.</p>
<p>To make effective use of Citizen Helpers within these settings we are developing (i) algorithms to model and predict the accuracy and trustworthiness of Citizen Helper generated content, (ii) methodologies and data models that allow us to track and reason about the provenance of information collected in this way, (iii) and mechanisms that allow us to target which Citizen Helpers are asked which questions based on learned models of their capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Now everyone can help the Ministry protect and safeguard our most prized asset: the Truth!</strong></p>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q5">What are my duties as a Citizen Helper?</a></h2>
<p>As a Citizen Helper it is your task to check, inspect and report on the provenance of documents. As explained above, provenance is an important aspect of our lives, therefore it is crucial that the provenance records of the Ministry of Provenance are (i) up-to-date and (ii) correct.</p>
<p>Sadly, due to the not ideal conditions previous governmental structures had to operate under, some of our records do not live up to these high standards.</p>
<p>This is where you come in!</p>
<p>The MoP uses a shared document pool system. Each Citizen Helper is able to view which documents need processing. At the current stage of the ORCHID scheme you are then able to choose which document you would like to work on. (It is our goal to automate this process in a later stage of the ORCHID scheme.)</p>
<p>We expect you to process a certain amount of documents each week depending on your capabilities.</p>
<p>Processing a document means:
<ul>
<li>inspecting all nodes and all attributes</li>
<li>be on the lookout for inconsistencies</li>
<li>report the inconsistencies (or the lack thereof) back the responsible unit</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2><a class="internal" id="q6">How do I acquire documents?</a></h2>
<p>Depending on your clearance level, you will have access to a pool of documents that are shared with other Citizen Helpers of the same (or a lower) clearance level as you.</p>
<p>You can find an overview of these documents on the <a href="{% url 'mop_documents_pool' %}">Document Pool</a> page.</p>
<p>You may choose which document you would like assigned to you by filling in the necessary forms and submitting a request to the relevant MoP unit.</p>
<p><strong>Always make sure you have the right form.</strong></p>
<p>You can request tasks through the message interface by following these steps:
<ol>
<li>Compose a new message.</li>
<li>Choose the appropriate unit as recipient.</li>
<li>Select "Requesting Document" as the subject.</li>
<li>Attach the appropriate form to the message.</li>
<li>Send the message.</li>
<li>Once your request has been processed, you will get a notification message.</li>
<li>Barring errors in your request, the document will be assigned to you.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="{% url 'mop_documents' %}">Document Drawer</a> page and start working!</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q7">How do I acquire forms?</a></h2>
<p>Every MoP Unit requires a different form for different requests. There are forms to request forms, to request documents and to submit a processed document.</p>
<p>You may request forms in the same way as requesting documents: by filling in a blank Form Request Form which is available to you and sending it to the Unit of Administration.</p>
<p>Once you acquire a blank form of a certain type, you may use it as many times as you wish. Blank forms you have already acquired can be seen in the <a href="{% url 'mop_forms_blank' %}">Blank Forms</a> page.</p>
<p>The following is a comprehensive list of forms that are currently available from the Unit of Administration:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Unit</th><th>Form</th><th>Type</th><th>Identifier</th></tr>
{% for req in requisition_list %}
	<tr><td>{{req.unit.serial}}</td><td>{{req.name}}</td><td>{{req.get_category_display}}</td><td>{{req.serial}}</td></tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
<p><strong>Remember: Only the Unit of Administration hands out new forms! Send all your requests for new forms to the Unit of Adminstration!</strong></p>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q8">How can I process a document?</a></h2>
<p>In order to process an assigned document, you only need to open it in the Provenance Record Observation, Processing and Manipulation Tool (PROMPT).</p>
<p>PROMPT allows you as a non-expert user to visually browse the provenance of a specific document, making it easy for you to view all relevant nodes and attributes - all at the touch of a button while enjoying the comfort of your home!</p>
<p>With PROMPT you can:
<ul>
<li>Drag and Drop nodes around to arrange them in your preferred way</li>
<li>Highlight nodes for inspection</li>
<li>Quickly compare data between different nodes in the inspection pane</li>
<li>Mark attributes for a suspected inconsistency</li>
<li>Save those suspected inconsistency as a report</li>
<li>Mark a document as 'correct' in case no inconsistencies have been found</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Saving a document prepares it to be sent as a report:
<ul>
<li>just fill in the appropriate form (see above)</li>
<li>compose a new mail to the relevant unit</li>
<li><strong>don't forget to attach the document itself!</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q9">What happens after I submit a report?</a></h2>
<p>When you file a report, your marked data will be compared with the work of other Citizen Helpers as well as analyzed by clerks and software of the unit that issued the document.</p>
<p>If your report is deemed correct, you will be rewarded, otherwise a penalty will be applied to your record.</p>
<p>The incentive engineers of MoP have devised a point-based system to track your performance called TRUST (Track Record of Undertaken System Tasks). We are constanlty monitoring your activities as a Citizen Helper and are therefore able to provide almost instant feedback - which will hopefully enable you to perform better in the future.</p>
<p>You gain TRUST in the following way (depending on the clearance level of the relevant document):</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Activity</th><th>BLUE / GREEN / YELLOW / ORANGE / RED</th></tr>
<tr><td>Requesting Document</td><td style="text-align:center">0 / -10 / -20 / -30 / -40</td></tr>
<tr><td>Submitting Correct Report</td><td style="text-align:center">+10 / +30 / +50 / +80 / +150</td></tr>
<tr><td>Submitting Incorrect Report</td><td style="text-align:center">-5 / -15 / -25 / -40 / -75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Non-submitted Document</td><td style="text-align:center">-5 / -15 / -25 / -40 / -75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unnecessary Mail</td><td style="text-align:center">-1</td></tr>
</table>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q10">How can I reach a higher Clearance Level?</a></h2>
<p>The Ministry of Provenance operates under 5 clearance levels: BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW, ORANGE and RED.</p>
<p>Each Citizen Helper starts at the lowest clearance level: BLUE. At the end of every week there will be a performance review. Depending on the TRUST you earned in the past performance period, your clearance level will be adjusted. If you did especially well, you will reach a higher level of clearance. If your performance was sub-par, you will be assigned a lower clearance level.</p>
<p>Additionally, at the start of a new performance period, your TRUST will be reset to 0 to incentivize you to work at a steady pace.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: A higher clearance level means a higher level of responsibility.</strong></p>
<table>
<tr><th>TRUST earned</th><th>Resulting Clearance</th></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center">&#8804; 99</td><td style="text-align:center">BLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center">100 - 199</td><td style="text-align:center">GREEN</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center">200 - 299</td><td style="text-align:center">YELLOW</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center">300 - 499</td><td style="text-align:center">ORANGE</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center">&#8805; 500</td><td style="text-align:center">RED</td></tr>
</table>
<h2><a class="internal" id="q11">What happens if I do not have enough TRUST to request documents?</a></h2>
<p>At first sight it might seem that at the start of a performance period in a higher clearance level, you are unable to acquire a document of that clearance level due to your TRUST being reset to 0.</p>
<p>However, at the end of a performance period you will also gain virtual TRUST credits over the amount of 15% of your last TRUST. This allows you to instantly start working on documents of your current clearance level.</p>
<p>Note, however, that these virtual TRUST credits will not be taken into consideration for your evaluation at the end of the performance period.</p>
<p>If you should ever find yourself having negative TRUST: Just work on some BLUE documents until you have regained enough for more delicate documents.</p>
