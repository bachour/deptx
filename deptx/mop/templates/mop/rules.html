<h1>Rules</h1>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>
Your job is it to finish tasks.<br/>
You find the available tasks under "Tasks".<br/>
Depending on your trust level there will be more tasks available for you.<br/>
If you want to work on a task, note down its task identification number.<br/>
Fill in all necessary data into the appropriate form (depending on the MOP unit handing out the task)<br/>
Compose a new message.<br/>
Send the message to the appropriate unit<br/>
Select "Rquesting Task" as the subject<br/>
Attach the appropriate form to the message.<br/>
Send the message.<br/>
After a while you should get a notification message.<br/>
If everything was correct with your form, the task will now be assigned to you.<br/>
Go back to "Tasks" and start working!
</p>
<h2>Documents</h2>
Each task has documents relevant for it.<br/>
Before you can work with the documents, you need to request them.<br/>
Requesting a document works the same as requesting a task or a form.<br/>
Just fill in the appropriate form and send it to the unit that is storing the document.<br/>
Soon the document will be in your document drawer.
<h2>Forms</h2>
<p>
Every MOP Unit requires a different form for different requests<br/>
There are forms to reuqest forms, to request tasks and to request documents.<br/>
The following forms are currently available:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>responsible unit</th><th>form</th><th>usage</th><th>code</th><th>trust level</th></tr>
{% for req in requisition_list %}
	<tr><td>{{req.unit.name}}</td><td>{{req.name}}</td><td>{{req.description}}</td><td>{{req.serial}}</td><td>{{req.trust}}</td></tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
